# Wine Fermentation Chamber Project
This project turns a seldom used kegerator into a wine fermentation chamber! I will progressively improve this project from a minimum viable product (MVP) stage through to something hopefully fairly elegant and resilient.

### Motivation
I needed a controlled environment for the fermentation process. Living in Arizona doesn't always enable maintaining temperatures consistently for 2+ months. The wine kit instructions (for the Malbec I'm making now) say it is critical to maintain temperatures between 22-24 degrees Centigrade (72-75 degree Fahrenheit).

## Hardware
* Wine Kit: I'm using a Malbec kit from [winexpert.com](https://winexpert.com))
* Working kegerator - I have a Vissani from [Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/catalog/pdfImages/89/894db3fc-a2a8-4a2d-a149-49658eb58ddd.pdf)
* Winemaking equipment (bucket, carboy, thief, etc)
* Raspberry Pi
* 2-DHT11 sensors
* 433Mhz transmitter
* Etekcity ZAP 5LX Remote outlet switches
